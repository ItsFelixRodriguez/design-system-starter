# design-system-starter

Hello! 

This was a fun project I did as part of Codecademy. It is a design system template. I based it on the Zinc color palette from Tailwind CSS and chose my own fonts via Google Fonts. 

I plan to build a personal portfolio using this template. I know it is sill but I especcialy like the border colors.
